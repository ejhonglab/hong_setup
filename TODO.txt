-add printer (or at least prompt for IP and do the rest, assuming same model) 
 -set to two-sided (long edge)
 -any way to make it so it doesn't always prompt to use letter instead of A4?
  -what is telling it to use A4? is it program dependent (mendeley for example)


- add both NASs in "connect to a server" menu w/ consistent names
