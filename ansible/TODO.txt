- make bootstrapping script to change passwords on all accounts / setup keys
  for ansible? (use ansible-inventory --list -i hosts and parse JSON hosts ->
  iterate?)

- script (part of script?) to symlink this host file into default place?
  or point to this?

- add AllowUsers lab tom (approp re: group) to sshd_config?

- support for adding groups of IPs outside of the VPN to the VPN?
